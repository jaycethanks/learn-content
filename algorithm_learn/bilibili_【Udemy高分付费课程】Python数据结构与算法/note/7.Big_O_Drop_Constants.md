There are a few ways in which we can simplify out big O notation(угдтЈи) and we'll look at a few of those as we go through this section. 

**Drop Constants**

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)
    for j in range(n):
        print(j)

print_items(10)
```

So we can discribe this as `O(2n)`, but we can actually simplify this by dropping the constant , then it gonna be `O(n)`.
