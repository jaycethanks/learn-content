 Let's say you have a list with seven items in it ,and you're going to build a for-loop to iterate through this list to find a specific number.

If your target number is `1`, this called your best case scenario, you gonna find this in one operation.  But if you're looking fort the number `7`, this is your worst case scenario. You have to iterate through the entire list  to be able to get it. If you're looking for the number `4`, this gonna be your average case.

So when someone talks about the best case scenario, that is **Omega Ω**， the average  case is **Theta θ**, and the worst case is **Omicron O**.

So When people talk about **Big O**, they actually talk about the **Worst Case**.
