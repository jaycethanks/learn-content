## What is Big O ?

Big O is a way of  comparing code one in code two mathematically about how efficient they run.

## What is Time Complexity ?

Imagine there are two code snippets, A, B; If we run A takes 10s, while B takes 30s. And based on this , you would say that A is better than B, you can measure it. 

This is called **time complexity**.

And the thing about time complexity that is interesting is that **it's not measured in time**! Because if you took the same code and run it on different computers. the result time may not the same. So **it's measured in the number of operations** that it takes to complete something.

## What  is Space Complexity ?

Space Complexity means the memory size needed for code runs.
